# Readme-generator

## Description

This is a command line application that runs using Node, and NPM packages such as Inquirer which I used to prompt users with an array of objects for the questions. 

The purpose of this README, is to help developers generate simple README's with the neccessary information for the project.

During the application I really got to see how beneficial NPM & template literals were. 

## Installation

For this application I was provided with the  starter code with contained the main JS file, package.JSON, and acceptance criteria. 

Afterwards, I installed the correct packages such as Inquirer so that my prompts within the JS file would run on Node; I did this by running a NPM install command.

Finally, I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync.

The main feature of this application is that you can generate a simple README file, running Javascript on the backend.
